# PyNet Intelligence - About the Author

Hi! My name is Jamie Weiss and I wrote PyNet Intelligence. Thank you for visiting my documentation.  I plan on continuing to update this application as much as I possibly can. A special thanks to [Ming Chow](https://twitter.com/0xmchow) for inspiring me to study cybersecurity and pursue my project ideas.

### Future Updates

A lot of my original ideas were bounded by the lack of modularity in the Streamlit package I used for the web development.  This is because at this time, Streamlit is very new.  They have built a great product and are continuing to add features.  As they add features, so will I!

Here is a list of some ideas I had for the future.  If anybody has other ideas feel free to contact me, and if anyone is interested in helping contribute that would be awesome!

* Docker Container for the project
* Deployment on cloud based server (Heroku or AWS)
* Development of the API and Documentation for it
* More modularity for the user to run different levels of scans
* Parallel computing for runing simultaneous scans
* More Visualization (bounded by Streamlit)
* More non-web based vulnerability scans
